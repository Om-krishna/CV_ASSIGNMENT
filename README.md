# About the research paper


In recent  days,  skin  cancer  is  seen  as  one  of  the  most  Hazardous  form  of  the  Cancers  found  in  Humans.  Skin  cancer is found in various types such as Melanoma, Basal and Squamous cell Carcinoma among which Melanoma is the most unpredictable. The detection of Melanoma cancer in early stage can be helpful to cure it. Computer vision can play important role in Medical Image Diagnosis and it has been proved by many existing systems. In this paper, we present a computer aided method for the detection of Melanoma Skin Cancer using Image Processing tools. The input to the system is the skin lesion image and then by applying novel image processing techniques, it analyses  it to conclude  about  the  presence  of  skin  cancer.  The  Lesion  Image  analysis  tools  checks  for  the  various  Melanoma  parameters  Like  Asymmetry,  Border,  Colour,  Diameter,(ABCD)  etc.  by  texture,  size  and  shape  analysis  for  image  segmentation and feature stages. The extracted feature parameters are used to classify the image as Normal skin and Melanoma cancer lesion.
